    <h1>About us</h1>
    <div id="para">
    <h4>Tutors create profiles that list their experience, education, and an explanation of their teaching philosophy. Our team then interviews them, verifies their information, and runs a background check. With a 100% money back guarantee and a robust review and rating system, students and parents love and trust our services.

Expert educators use our platform because we do the work of finding students and processing payments for them. Our company also makes it easy to keep track of your schedule and sessions, as well increase the overall amount of student visibility. We emphasize transparency with low transaction fees that decrease over time and reward loyal tutors. This money goes towards the maintenance and improvement of the gooroo platform and towards increasing the scope of the Gooroo Community.
